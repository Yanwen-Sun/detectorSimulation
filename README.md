# detectorSimulation
Generate hard x-ray detector images at sparse photon limit considering readout noise, inhomogeneity and charge sharing
1. Run generateSpeckles.py to get a set of speckle patterns with different contrast level. 
2. Use generateDetectorImages to get detector images at a intensity level defined by kbar.
